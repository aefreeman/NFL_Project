# NFL_Project
This repository is a part of my NFL project (https://aefreeman.github.io/NFL_Playoffs/Revamping_Playoffs.html).
The attached CSV files are required for both the Opps_Interactive.py (local Dash app - runs on Heroku link in the write up) and Opponents_Graph.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook version of Dash app).
